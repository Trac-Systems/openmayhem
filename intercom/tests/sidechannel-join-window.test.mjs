// Regression test for the bootstrap-window join race.
//
// The SC-Bridge WS server accepts clients (index.js) BEFORE `sidechannel.start()`
// resolves, so a client can send `join` while start() is still inside its
// awaited `swarm.flush()` (bounded at 10s, and preceded by the DHT bootstrap
// wait). In that window `sidechannel.started` is still false, so `addChannel`
// used to skip `swarm.join` entirely — while start()'s own join loop had already
// run. The topic therefore ended up registered but never announced: invisible to
// discovery until the process restarted. The bridge nevertheless answered
// `{type:'joined'}` immediately, so the client was told it had joined a channel
// no peer could find.
//
// The fix is a pair:
//   1. start() re-scans this.channels after the flush and announces whatever was
//      registered during the window (idempotent joins make this harmless).
//   2. addChannel resolves only once the topic is genuinely announced, so the
//      bridge's `joined` reply can no longer lie.
//
// These tests drive the real Sidechannel and the real ScBridge message handler
// against a swarm stub whose flush() is resolved by hand, which is what makes the
// window observable.
